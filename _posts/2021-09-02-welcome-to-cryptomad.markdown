This is our very first post. Welcome!

We will be hosting seminars on applied cryptography, taught by cryptographers in
the area of Madrid, Spain. Although, hopefully, we will eventually host national 
and international speakers from time to time. Some sessions will be held 
physically, some online, some both.

Madrid has gained critical mass on applied cryptographers in the past few years.
Our goal is to form community, and foster collaboration.

We will be announcing seminar dates soon. Stay tuned! You can follow us on

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
